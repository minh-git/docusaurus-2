Imagine, if you will, a city wherein assassins and thugs offer their services out of brightly lit
shops with vibrant signs which explain exactly what you can purchase or lease. This is the world of the
Weapon-Wielders.

When the robots were building Paw City, they needed to protect their work from vandalism
caused by the nomads of the wasteland. After carefully scanning the incoming Cat Punks’ genetic
makeup, they discovered some early citizens showed a propensity for violence. Rather than waste them,
the robots with military programming trained them and promised them free reign to peddle their
newfound skills.

The deal worked well. Within a year, there was a mile-wide perimeter around the city that no
nomad would breach. If the bodies rotting on crude scaffolds were disconcerting to the arriving
residents, so be it. They served their purpose.

As time went on, new arrivals began to hire Weapon-Wielders for their personal needs. The
City-Runners especially appreciated them as they provided a reliable method of removing malcontents
and defectives.

Only the Awakened, for reasons of their own, demurred when offered the services of the
Weapon-Wielders.

Despite their hyper-violent heritage, the Weapon-Wielders are respected members of society.
Many new Weapon-Wielders hone their skills in the Calamity Coliseum run by the Punks. It’s a great way
for them to earn a few extra creds and not die. It also saved the Weapon-Wielders from building their
own training facility. Everyone looks at it as a win/win situation.
